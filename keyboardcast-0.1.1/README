This is keyboardcast.

The purpose of keyboardcast is to allow you to send keystrokes to multiple
X windows at once.  This allows you, for example, to control a number of
terminals connected to different but similar hosts for purposes of mass-
administration.

You can also select non-terminals.  If you come up with a reasonable use
for this ability I'd be interested in hearing about it.

The program can select windows to send to either by matching their titles
(using a substring) or by clicking on them (in a method similar to GIMP's
screenshot feature).

The program also features the ability to spawn off multiple instances of
gnome-terminal executing a single command on multiple arguments (for example
executing 'ssh' on several hosts).  The gnome-terminals are invoked with
the profile 'keyboardcast' if it exists (so, for example, your font size
can be smaller).

Bug reports should be filed in Launchpad against product 'keyboardcast'.
Other comments can be e-mailed to me directly.
